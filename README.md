To display a welcome message in C, you can use the `printf()` function. The `printf()` function is a library function that allows you to print formatted output to the console.\n\nTo use the `printf()` function, you must first include the `stdio.h` header file. This header file contains the declaration for the `printf()` function.\n\nOnce you have included the `stdio.h` header file, you can use the `printf()` function to print your welcome message. For example, the following code will print the welcome message \"Welcome to C!\" to the console:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n  printf(\"Welcome to C!\\n\");\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\nYou can also use the `printf()` function to print more complex welcome messages. For example, the following code will print a welcome message that includes the user's name:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n  char name[20];\n\n  printf(\"Enter your name: \");\n  scanf(\"%s\", name);\n\n  printf(\"Hello, %s!\\nWelcome to C!\\n\", name);\n\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis code will prompt the user to enter their name. Once the user has entered their name, the code will print a welcome message that includes the user's name.\n\nYou can use the `printf()` function to create any type of welcome message you want. You can use it to print simple messages, complex messages, or even messages that include user input.
